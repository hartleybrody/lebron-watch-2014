# #LebronWatch2014

Instead of checking for news about Lebron every few seconds manually, let's write a bot that alerts us the moment there's actual news.

Right now it checks his website and twitter account, and sounds an alarm if either has updates.

## Running
Check this out locally and install dependencies `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

Run from the command line with with the proper flags, depending what you want to check:

* `-t` / `--twitter` to check for new Tweets
* `-w` / `--website` to check to see if his website has changed

## Send Pull Requests!
Other things we should be checking? Let me know.
